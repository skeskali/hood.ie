## Design

> I‚Äôve been paying close attention to these small breaks in UX that some people seem so happy to write off‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe misplaced humor, the snotty error messages, the binary gender selection boxes, the assumptions about sexuality, the inability to select more than one race. What I‚Äôve realized is that the best way to look at them is as a series of microaggressions.

>Lots of people think caring about these microaggressions is a waste of time, too: Stop being so sensitive! There are more important issues in the world! Everyone‚Äôs a victim these days!

> Mostly the people who don‚Äôt experience them.

> For those who do, they‚Äôre exhausting. They stack up over the course of a day, a week at work, a lifetime of being fed the same BS. A million tiny moments where you were reminded that you don‚Äôt fit in, or that you‚Äôre not ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù or that others view your body as fair game.

## The Business

> Most of these people don‚Äôt believe in anything except their balance sheet, and they know how to add two and two. On political interests: they are a parallelogram of different and typically conflicting goals, never defined by one goal only: industrial capital, financial capital, governing parties, states, sometimes the labor aristocracy, all interacting under the pressure of ‚Äî changing ‚Äî power relations.

does a great job to make this first experience stellar. 

We can‚Äôt thank [Jenn](https://github.com/renrutnnej) enough these days! Not only does she do an amazing

## Hoodie Camp Release

As we mentioned in our [Birthday Post](http://hood.ie/blog/happy-birthday-hoodie.html),
[we are getting close](http://gr2m.github.io/milestones) to release an all new Hoodie Version!

We call it "Hoodie Camp Release" because it‚Äôs still rough around the edges, but
we made sure that it‚Äôs a lot of fun to be part of it :) We keep track of [open
issues & questions](https://github.com/gr2m/milestones/issues/88), but here 
is a summary:

- [Implement username change](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account/issues/79)  
  The new Hoodie Server does not handle a username change correctly. If you like
  [hapi](http://hapijs.com/) and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), you will
  enjoy working on this issue :)
- There is an issue with [disappearing items after login in](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker/issues/19)
  as mentioned above. We could use some help with finding out what is causing it :)
- We would like to [unify Hoodie‚Äôs test setup](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/issues/457) across all repositories,
  to make it an even nicer experience to contribute code.
- We found a way to [simplify Hoodie‚Äôs Account JSON API](https://github.com/hoodiehq/account-json-api/issues/14),
  and we would like to do this before promoting the new Hoodie version

We also have a few open questions and would love to hear your thoughts on them.
Thanks [Mike](https://github.com/mikehedman), [Ransom](https://github.com/ransomw),
[Jan](https://github.com/janl), [Stephan](https://github.com/boennemann), [Nick](https://github.com/nickcolley)
and [Lewis](https://github.com/lewiscowper) for your feedback!
